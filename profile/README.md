## :globe_with_meridians: What is UI5?

UI5 represents a collaborative effort to provide developers with a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for building modern, enterprise-grade web applications in an efficient way. It fosters the growth and evolution of this toolkit, which includes the open-source framework OpenUI5 at its core. 

## :rocket: Our mission 

Welcome to the official open-source home of the UI5 Community — a collaborative space jointly driven by SAP and the community. Our mission is to foster innovation, openness, and shared ownership around the OpenUI5 ecosystem.
Here, we host and grow a diverse range of UI5-related projects — from custom libraries and controls, to UI5 Tooling extensions like middlewares and tasks, as well as complementary tools for testing, integration, and beyond.
